# RefactorExample
 
This is an example of a partial refactor I did in the context of a group class project.  
The original code was functional, but had large amounts of repeated code, had several potential failure points, and made modification challenging.
As this was a group project, one of my goals was to retain as much of the original work as possible.  
As a result, this doesn't necessarily represent the way I would approach the problem, so much as my ability to identify the low hanging fruit and create a more robust solution.
